# Canteen-Menu-UID

A modern, user-friendly web platform for a college canteen, allowing students to browse the menu, add items to cart, place orders, and pay via a UPI QR code, with admin and billing controls for canteen staff.

Features
User Login & Registration
Account-based ordering with persistent session and order history.

Browse & Search Menu
View items by category: Beverages, Food, Snacks, Desserts.

Add to Cart & Checkout
Modern cart UI, clear order summary, bill-style display (like Swiggy/KFC).

Scan & Pay (UPI QR)
Easy payment by scanning QR code; to be upgraded for real payment gateway soon.

Order Management & Admin Portal
Stock management, restock, and item administration (admin login required).

Real-Time Quantity Sync
Menu automatically reflects stock/depletion after orders.

Quickstart Guide
1. Project Structure
text
canteen-project/
 ├── index.html (or menu.html)
 ├── server.js
 ├── users.json (auto-generated on first login)
 ├── upi.jpg
 ├── images/...
 ├── package.json/package-lock.json
 └── README.md
2. Running Locally
Backend
bash
npm install
node server.js
Make sure you have Node.js installed.

The server will serve API endpoints for menu, auth, and orders on localhost.

Frontend
You can open index.html directly or visit http://localhost:3000 (if served by Express).

Make sure upi.jpg (your QR) is in the root folder and accessible.

3. Usage
Register a new user or login with existing credentials.

Browse, add items to the cart, and check the current bill (see order summary section).

Scan the provided UPI QR for payment.

Submit order and receive an on-screen bill (order details are stored and viewable).

Admins can login with the password and manage menu, prices, and stock levels.

4. Key Code Highlights
Authentication:
Users are registered and logged in with simple forms. Credentials and orders are saved in users.json (for demo; migrate to DB for production).

Cart & Billing:
Live cart/bill display, with order details rendered in a neat table inspired by delivery app UIs. After payment (QR scan), user places the order.

Menu & Stock Sync:
Menu item availability and remaining stock update in real-time—admins and users see up-to-date information.

Payment:
Currently supports UPI QR for instant payment.
Future: Will be expanded with payment gateway integration (Razorpay, Paytm, etc.), which will authorize and confirm real payments.

Future Enhancements
Polished UI/UX:
The current UID is functional and easy to use but will be refined to match professional food apps even more closely, with smoother animations, cleaner layouts, and mobile-first design.

Verified Payment Integration:
Payment confirmation and order processing via official payment gateways (Razorpay, Paytm) planned in v2.0.

User Profile & Order History:
Users will be able to review their past orders and download their bills anytime.

Role-Based Access:
More robust admin/staff/user separation, audit logs, and analytics in backend.

Security Best Practices:
Password hashing, secure session management, and input validation.

How to Deploy/Setup in Production
For college/office: Deploy server on a campus machine or cloud.

Set environment variables (e.g., for DB/payments) for secure, scalable hosting.

Update payment integration code as and when Gateway credentials are available.

Replace or update static files (e.g., upi.jpg) as needed.
